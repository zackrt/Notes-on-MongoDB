notes on MongoDB:

1. social apps: if you have celebrity users, they may overflow any document that you're storing followers in.

2. the aggregation framework cannot write to collections, so all results must be returned to the client. Thus, aggregation results are limited to 16 MB of data (pg. 129) 

3. Managing Consistency: Note that this is a per-connection queue: if we open two shells, we will have two connections to the database. If we perform an insert into 1 shell, a subsequent query in the other shell might NOT return the inserted document (pg 163)
